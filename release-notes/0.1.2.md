# Release Notes - v0.1.2

## 🎉 New Features

### React Hooks Support in Top-Level Components

This version introduces support for React hooks in the topmost components, enabling developers to use hooks in:

- **Layout components** - Use hooks for state management, effects, and context in layout wrappers
- **Page components** - Full hook support in page-level components for enhanced functionality

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Build Failures**: Fixed build failures that previously occurred when using React hooks in layout or page components
- **Hook Engine Initialization**: Improved hook engine initialization to prevent rendering issues during server-side rendering

## 📝 Summary

Previously, attempting to use React hooks in either layout or page components would result in build failures. This release resolves these issues by implementing proper hook engine initialization, allowing developers to leverage the full power of React hooks throughout their component hierarchy.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Client-Side Requirements

React hooks will not function on the client side without a proper build step for the components. To enable client-side hook support, you must use a build plugin such as [`frame-master-plugin-apply-react`](https://github.com/shpaw415/frame-master-plugin-apply-react/tree/main) in your project.

**Recommended setup:**

```bash
# Install the required plugin
bun install frame-master-plugin-apply-react
```

This plugin handles the necessary component transformations to ensure hooks work correctly during client-side rendering.
