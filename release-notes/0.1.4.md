# Release Notes - v0.1.4

## 🎉 New Features

### `usePath` Hook

Introducing the `usePath` hook, which returns the current path on both server and client side.

**How it works:**

- **Server-side**: Based on `React.Provider` that provides the current path during server-side rendering
- **Client-side**: Based on the current `window.location.pathname` ( if used with a client-side plugin. )

**Example Usage:**

```ts
// src/pages/blog/index.tsx
import { usePath } from "frame-master-plugin-react-to-html/hooks";

function ShowCurrentPath() {
  const path = usePath(); // path = "/blog"
  return <p>{path}</p>;
}
```

## 📝 Summary

This release adds the `usePath` hook, providing a unified way to access the current route path in your components, working seamlessly on both server and client side.
